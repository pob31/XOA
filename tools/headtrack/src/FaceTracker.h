/**
    Face detection + head-pose estimation.

    YuNet (OpenCV Zoo, MIT) returns a face box plus five landmarks; the head
    angles are computed geometrically from the three robust ones (eye centers
    + nose tip) with the axes decoupled by construction — see
    anglesFromLandmarks for the reasoning (and why this is NOT a solvePnP).
    A dense-mesh landmark model would sharpen absolute accuracy; the plugin
    ABI exists so that swap needs no app change.

    Not thread-safe: one instance belongs to the inference thread.

    /**
        Head angles from the three robust landmarks (eyes + nose tip), with
        the axes DECOUPLED by construction:

          roll  — slope of the eye line, and nothing else. A nod cannot leak
                  into roll.
          yaw   — horizontal offset of the (protruding) nose tip from the
                  mid-eye point, measured in the de-rolled frame.
          pitch — vertical drop of the nose tip below the eye line, ditto.

        This replaced a 5-point solvePnP: the mouth corners are unreliable
        under facial hair, and with only five points that noise aliased across
        axes (a nod read mostly as roll on a bearded face). Eye centers and
        nose tip are YuNet's most stable outputs — glasses shift the eye
        centers roughly symmetrically, and beards don't touch them at all.

        Small-angle geometry of a nose protruding p in front of the eye
        baseline (interocular D): turning by ψ shifts the tip laterally by
        ~p·sin ψ, i.e. sin ψ ≈ (offset/D) / kNoseRatio with kNoseRatio = p/D.
        Absolute gain therefore depends on the wearer's nose (±25 % across
        faces) and the frontal values carry a constant bias — both are
        harmless: Set Zero removes the bias, and the renderer only needs
        relative motion with the right sign.

        The kSign* constants exist because mirroring differs between camera
        drivers — validated with the smoke host (shake / nod / tilt), and the
        only thing to flip if a camera reports mirrored.
